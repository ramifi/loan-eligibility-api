# Unit Tests Summary - Loan Eligibility Logic

## Overview
Created comprehensive unit tests for the loan eligibility logic in `LoanService`. All tests are passing (15 tests total).

## Test Coverage

### Eligibility Calculation Tests (11 tests)

#### 1. Credit Score Validation
- ✅ **Rejects applications with credit score below 700**
  - Tests that applications with credit score < 700 are rejected
  - Verifies the rejection reason is "Credit score too low"

#### 2. Income-to-Payment Ratio Validation
- ✅ **Rejects applications when monthly income is too low**
  - Tests the 1.5x income-to-payment ratio requirement
  - Formula: `requiredIncome = (requestedAmount / loanTermMonths) * 1.5`
  - Verifies income must be > required income (not equal to)

- ✅ **Rejects applications with income exactly at threshold**
  - Edge case: Tests that income must be strictly greater than required income
  - Ensures the boundary condition is correctly handled

- ✅ **Approves applications with minimum qualifying income**
  - Tests that income just above the threshold is accepted

#### 3. Crime Grade Validation
- ✅ **Rejects applications when crime grade is F**
  - Tests that properties with F crime grade are rejected
  - Verifies the rejection reason is "Crime grade too low"

- ✅ **Handles different crime grades correctly**
  - Tests all valid crime grades (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-)
  - Ensures only F grade is rejected

#### 4. Successful Eligibility Scenarios
- ✅ **Approves applications when all criteria are met**
  - Tests the happy path with all requirements satisfied
  - Verifies reason is "Passed all checks"

- ✅ **Approves applications with minimum qualifying credit score (700)**
  - Edge case: Tests that credit score of exactly 700 is accepted

#### 5. Edge Cases and Complex Scenarios
- ✅ **Handles different loan terms correctly**
  - Tests that monthly payment calculation works with different loan terms
  - Verifies 15-year vs 30-year loan scenarios

- ✅ **Prioritizes credit score check over income check**
  - Tests the order of validation checks
  - Ensures credit score is checked before income

- ✅ **Prioritizes income check over crime grade check**
  - Tests the order of validation checks
  - Ensures income is checked before crime grade

### Validation Tests (4 tests)

#### 6. Input Validation
- ✅ **Validates complete loan application data**
  - Tests that valid data passes validation

- ✅ **Rejects incomplete loan application data**
  - Tests that missing fields are caught

- ✅ **Rejects loan application data with empty strings**
  - Tests that empty string values are treated as invalid

- ✅ **Rejects loan application data with zero values**
  - Tests that zero values are treated as invalid

## Eligibility Rules Tested

Based on the actual implementation, the tests verify:

1. **Credit Score Rule**: Must be >= 700
2. **Income Rule**: Monthly income must be > (requestedAmount / loanTermMonths) * 1.5
3. **Crime Grade Rule**: Must not be 'F'
4. **Validation Order**: Credit score → Income → Crime grade

## Test Framework
- **Framework**: Jest
- **Test File**: `src/services/__tests__/LoanService.test.ts`
- **Mocking**: AgentService and database are mocked to isolate the eligibility logic

## Running Tests
```bash
npm test
```
